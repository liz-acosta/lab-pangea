# Pangea Healthcare Example Backend

Forked from: https://github.com/nickesparza/ga-project-3-api

This is a MERN stack application; we leverage node.js and React with functional components for the frontend client application, along with React Bootstrap for styling. The client connects via Express with Mongoose to the MongoDB server on the backend.

Patient data is seeded in the mongoDB server according to the patient model. After that, the data can be manipulated by authenticated users inside the client.

## Installation Instructions
You need to install dependencies with `npm install`.
a seed script is available via `npm run seed` to provide some starter data to work with.
After that, `npm start` will launch both the mongoDB server and the react client.
